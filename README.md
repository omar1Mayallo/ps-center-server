# Playstation Center Server

While enjoying 🎮 PlayStation 🎮 gaming sessions with my friends 😁 at a local playstation center, I noticed that they have a system in place to calculate the time we spend on each gaming device. Inspired by this, I decided to build a program with similar functionality, but with some additional features to enhance the overall experience. Thus, I created the PS Center Server, an API that allows you to track and manage gaming sessions, calculate playtime on different devices, and incorporate additional functionalities like snack ordering and more.
